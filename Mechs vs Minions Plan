What is linked to each player ID
	- Their command line
	

The Command Line (struct)
	6 slots, all start as 0, but eventually become filled with a CARD struct
	Each card is then stored as 4 ints
		1 for isDamaged (binary)
		1 for color (RGBY as 0-3)
		1 for the card in the color (movement = 1, attack = 2, turn = 3)
		1 for the tier (int 1-3)
		
Player(struct)
	Player ID (int, 1-4)
	Orientation(int Left Right Up Down, but define L R U D as 0 1 2 3 I suppose)
	Location X (int 0-inf)
	Location Y (int 0-inf)


TURN ORDER
	Draw_Card


Deck (composed of an array of ints)
	Empty cards represented as a stored 0
	Live deck
		There should be some kind of int deckPos which tells where in the deck we are
		Start off with all the cards in the array, randomize the positions of elements in the array
	Turn start:
		Check for memory core, set int bonusDraw to the appropriate number
		Draw Cards
			cardsDrawn = 0
			If cardsDrawn < 5, Display the first 5+bonusDraw cards of the liveDeck array
				Players choose
				User inputs a number 1 to (5+bonusDraw) to select their card
					The selected card becomes 0
					cardsDrawn +=1
					next player turn
		increment deckPos by (5+bonusDraw)
		switch to Player_Choose_Card_Use phase

Player_Choose_Card_Use
	Increment through each player
		Display the player's command line
		Insert into Command Line or Scrap?
			Command Line
				What slot?
			Scrap
				What color? 
					Repair
						Which slot?
					Reorder
						Which tiles?
					Discard?
						Are you sure?
